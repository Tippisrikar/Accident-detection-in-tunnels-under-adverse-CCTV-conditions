# ðŸš¨ CCTV Tunnel Accident Detection Using Deep Learning
## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Developed a deep learning model using Faster R-CNN and SORT to detect accidents in tunnel CCTV footage within 10 seconds. Trained on 3,000+ COCO-formatted frames labeled via Roboflow, improving emergency response by reducing false positives.

This project aims to detect **accidents in tunnel environments** using **CCTV footage**. It uses a fine-tuned **Faster R-CNN** model for object detection and supports real-time or batch analysis on images and video. The project is implemented in **Python** using **PyTorch** and includes full training, evaluation, and inference workflows.
